    <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-600">I am a 4th year PhD Candidate at Harvard Business School in the Healthcare Management program. When not working you can find me hanging out with the nearest animal, be it puppy, snake, or spider. I spend most of my time thinking about the things in peoples jobs that drive them nuts. Right now that means the way organizations collect data and use databases, and the associated administrative burden. Generally, I am interested in using System Dynamics methods (a methodological framework to understand, and manage change by modeling the relationships between all parts of a system to see how those relationships influence the behavior of the system over time) to address points of friction that cause people to hate their jobs, mentally check out, and even quit.</p>
